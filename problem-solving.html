                <h3><u>Got blocked on a problem</u></h3>
                <p>I got blocked this sprint on the "SuperFizzBuzz" problem.<br>
                    <strong>The problem</strong> was, that I did not know where to start with what. I know the logic, but I did not know what syntax or methods
                    to use to code and create the outcome that was needed.
                    <br>
                    Some <strong>problem solving techniques</strong> I did were, Take a break. I went and did something completely different to try and refresh.
                    I then googled to see what I could find, This ended up with me looking at to much and then second guessing myself again.
                    Failing this, I talked to my squishy I have on my desk, And again I could explain the logic but couldnt think of where to start.
                    Since I still was getting nowhere, I reached out to my peers, and asked for help. They were very helpful
                    in giving me hints in ways of how I should be thinking and how to go about solving the problem.
                    With some progress, I took another break. Coming back with a clear head, I was able to solve the problem.
                    <br>  
                    I <strong>felt very fustrated</strong> throughout the process, As I could not get my logic out into syntax.
                    This led me to thinking, That I actually do not know what I am doing, And had me second guessing myself
                    if i actually am learning anything, And applying that knowledge. As seeing everybody else moving along
                    with the curriculum, and yet I was still stuck, Made me think maybe I am not up to speed with all this. 
                    <br>  
                    I <storng>learnt that,</strong> I should take more breaks often, I also learnt that reaching out for help is ok,
                    And that my peers are more then willing to help me achieve an outcome.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Solved a problem in elegant way</u></h3>
                <p>I guess an <strong>elegant way of solving a problem,</strong> is talking it out loud to my squishy.
                    This <strong>problem I had</strong> was if I was wondering if I should ask for help or not - As I have a hardtime interacting with people.
                    For a <strong>problem solving technique</strong> I talked to my squishy, As if I was asking for help.
                    This made it easier for me to reach out and ask for help, As I had already known what I was going to say,
                    And felt good about it as it was easy talking to my squishy about the problem,
                    I just had to relay that back in chat.
                    <storng>I learnt</storng> that its OK to ask for help, everyone gets stuck, And our peers are more then willing to 
                    lean a suggestion or a hint to let you know how to go about the certain problem.
                </p>

            <h1>Problem Solving Techniques</h1>
            <section class="blog-post-content">
                <h3><u>Pseudocode</u></h3>
                    <p>I havent used Pseudocode much, Definately something I need to practice more, As I find it can help get things out of your head,
                        Also give you steps to follow in roughly how to go about things.
                        I am not to confident using Pseudocode but am looking forward to giving it more thought.
                    </p>

                <h3><u>Trying something</u></h3>
                    <p>Im confident in trying something, Most the time I try somthing and it doesnt work, But atleast I know it doesnt,
                        Or it will give me a error , that I can then work out from there. Sometimes with trying something to often with it
                        returning errors all the time, Gets me abit disgruntled, and this is where I turn to another method.
                    </p>

                <h3><u>Rubber ducky method</u></h3>
                    <p>I am confident with the rubber ducky method, I use this almost daily, (I have a squishy). 
                        This helps me to break things down into a really simple form. Again if this still does not work,
                        I go to google.
                    </p>
                <h3><u>Reading error messages</u></h3>
                <p>Semi confident in readign error messages, As it usually tells you what is wrong/where.
                    Sometimes I get confused with what it is returning or asking with certain syntax.
                    I hope to improve on this.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Console.logging</u></h3>
                <p>Console.logging I am not to confident in, Mainly as I barely use it, over this sprint I found myself wanting to use it more
                    to get an indication of where I was at. I found that console logging often, Can show you what your code is doing and
                    give you an indication of what to do next.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Googling</u></h3>
                <p>Google is King! - Although sometimes I find myself looking at to many solutions to the problem I am trying to solve,
                    and this leaves me more confused then when I started searching.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Asking your peers for help</u></h3>
                <p>I am not confident asking my peers for help, I usually do as a last resort, After I have tried other problem solving techniques.
                    This is because, I know my peers are most likely busy, and I dont like to contact people unless I absoulately need to.
                    When I do contact, this is usually over direct message, not in the public channels. As I feel it is better just to have one input to 
                    bounce off.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Asking coaches for help</u></h3>
                <p>I have not done this yet, I may in future, This would be my last resort I think.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Improving Your Process With Reflection</u></h3>
                <p>I need to reflect more, Maybe start scheduling in some night 'reflection' sessions. As i feel like I am not retaining things that I should know.</p>
