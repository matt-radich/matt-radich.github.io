            <h1>Identity / Values / Strengths</h1>
            <section class="blog-post-content">
                <h3><u>Core Personal Values</u></h3>
                <p>Respect, Belief, Trust the process</p>

                <h3><u>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
                the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</u></h3>
                <p></p>

                <h3><u>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</u></h3>
                <p>My culture has influenced me respect,inclusion,and empathy<br>
                    <strong>Respect</strong> - To be respectful of and to others<br>
                    <strong>Inclusion</strong> - To include all, even when they are not familiar to you, or when they are from different backgrounds or beliefs.<br>
                    <strong>Empathy</strong> - To have empathy towards everyone, regardless of what you think nor of how you feel about a certain topic or situation
                </p>

                <h3><u>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</u></h3>
                <p>About 1 1/2 years ago I was advised by a tutor to take a strengths test, He suggested the 'Gallup' one.
                I took this test, not thinking much of it. Results came in, And my top 5 were:<br>
                <strong>1 - Futuristic</strong><br><strong>2 - Achiever</strong><br><strong>3 - Harmony</strong><br>
                <strong>4 - Learner</strong><br><strong>5 - Belief</strong><br>
                I did not think much into it, but as I dived deeper into the results, and actually thought about who I was, Where I am, And Who I wanted to be
                They started to make more sense. 
                As yes I am inspired, passionate and energized about the future and what is possible and what the world could be.
                Achiever as I do work hard for what I want, and trust the process of getting there. Been productive makes me happy
                I have harmony towards others as I feel everyone has there own reason for their debate or disagreement,
                and who am I to say otherwise, I rather understand both sides and seek areas of agreement.
                Learning excites me, I have self learnt alot of things over the years, and if I am not learning I get agitated and feel there is more to life.
                Beliefs come down to my inner beliefs of my core values as a person, I keep these close.</p>

                <h3><u>My limitations:</u></h3>
                <p>tend to be my own learning at times, As i can get stuck down rabbit holes of learning and where one thing leads to as I am always looking for the next step.
                    This takes me away from the original task at hand and gets my mind going into what is next, instead of fousing on the present.
                    My independent work ethic, While this is good, It can stop me from being 100% in on group work, Or I tend to take on more then others in order to get group work done, Other then share the load and enjoy the journey.
                    My social tendencies, I am an introvert, I have no problems just being by myself, Or going about my journey as I want.
                    This tends to limit me to being social outside of my comfort zone, and taking the oppotunity away from my self to meet new people and try new things.
                    Self Belief is a big limitation of mine, As I often compare myself to those that are in the position that I want to be in,
                    or to those that already have the knowledge that I seek. In doing this, it lowers my self belief as I feel I am so far away, yet I have still accomplished so much.
                    I need to celebrate the small wins.</p>

                <h3><u>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
                    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</u></h3>
                    <p>My focus and drive will help me in my learning journey as I know where I want to be, and I know what has to be done to get there.
                        But I have noticed in the past that while this is good, It only gets me so far, as I tend to depend on myself for my results and learning,
                        Due to this I have come across conflict working in groups, As I do not like to depend on people for my work or results I am after.
                        With this comes self social distancing and extra work, Where If I just focused on the group,<br>
                        <strong>A)</strong> I would have more fun <strong>B)</strong> I could learn something I need to work on from people that I would like to know.</p>
                
                <h3><u>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
                    Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</u></h3>
                    <p>When I was studying at a previous tertiary education, We had a group project, Due to my social inactiveness I waited till last and just got put into a random group.
                        I did not mind this, as I knew I could do the work that was required. As the days/weeks went on, the communication in the group got low, Our idea for the project was not cemented
                        and it seemed we were going around in circles and getting nowhere while also getting behind, this created tention as it seemed nobody wanted to contribute or take charge of what has to be done.
                        Myself and one other took it upon ourselves to come up with a project and execute it. I was not excited about it, but it was the best we could do with the time we had.
                        While trying to execute this, We had other group members tapping in now and then, to see what was happening and how to do things. In the end we handed something in that was just ok.
                        My strategies at this time were, 'Dont worry ill get it done' and 'Just do this and you will be fine'. 
                        These were not very effective as A) It put more stress/workload on my self and one other B) To the group it seemed like I did not want them to work on the project much
                        What i would try now would be to, get the group together, talk about each others situations, lifestyles, how they are feeling towards the project, and work that they are wanting to do.
                        With this we couldve come up with a solution to include all with the same expectancy, have regular communication and check ins, which would of created a happier group environment and ultimately couldve done something exciting.</p>
