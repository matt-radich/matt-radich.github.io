                <h3><u>Neuroplasticity</u></h3>
                    <p>understanding neuroplasticity benefits people by knowing that it is actaully the process
                    by which all permanent learning takes place in your brain.<br> This tends to make your brain
                    resilient.<br> This happens as neuroplasticity allows the nerve cells in your brain
                    to adjust and over come things by forming new connections within your brain.
                </p>

                <h3><u>Engaging with Neuroplasticity for your own benefit</u></h3>
                <p>Start imagining how I can do certain things and go about certain things. As I can build the neuron strength
                    within the brain before I do it physically.<br>
                    Make sure im coding/doing something program related each day, as repetition matters.<br>
                    If I keep doing this , I can improve, If I stop this I may lose the knowledge or ability I once had.
                    Be resilient , As I know it is just my brain learning and improving.
                    </p>

                <h3><u>Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity</u></h3>
                    <p>Challenge your brain with activities that make it think, and solve problems.<br>
                    This may include games, Be it video games, puzzles, board games.<br>
                    Doing certain online games to do with coding are always good, To keep a certain way of thinking to solve problems.
                    You can learn a new language to speak - this will improve attention, memory, creative thinking and reading comprehension.
