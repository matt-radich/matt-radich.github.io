                <h3><u>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</u></h3>
                <p>I was once told that the differences and or relationship between HTMl, CSS and JavaScript
                    is similar to that of building a house<br><br>
                    
                    HTML is like the frame of the house, the supplies needed to build it. 
                    For example, A house has different rooms, doors, windows, furniture.
                    Which is similar to HTML that is made up of Header,Body,Footer.<br><br>
                    
                    CSS is the styling of the house, You want rooms to look different, have different colours,
                    maybe have all different furniture and art.
                    Which is similar to CSS, that defines how your webpage looks. We can apply different colours,
                    images, sizes of certain elements, and position them where we want.<br><br>
                    
                    JavaScript is the way you interact with your house, and the function that your house has.
                    For example, when you hit the light switch, the light comes on, Or when you turn a door handle 
                    the door unlocks and can open. 
                    Which is similar to Javascript on our webpage, We can interact with different elements and 
                    manipulate and modify them to function a certain way or produce something we want.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3><u>Control flow and loops:</u></h3>
                <p>Control flow is the order in which your computer executes your code or program.<br>
                    It runs your code from first line to last line.<br>
                    We cant just jump up and down the code and execute what we want, when we want.<br>
                    For example, Think of making a coffee in the morning. We must execute the steps from first to last in order to get the result that we want.
                </p>
                <ol style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
                    <li>Get a coffee cup</li>
                    <li>Put water in kettle</li>
                    <li>Boil water in kettle</li>
                    <li>Put desired amount of coffee in cup</li>
                    <li>Once boiled, Tip kettle water into coffee cup</li>
                    <li>Mix</li>
                </ol><br><br>
                <p>If you look at this example, There is a required set of steps to do what we want to do right.<br>
                    We cant mix the water and coffee together without a cup,
                    Also we cant boil the kettle when there is no water in it.<br>
                    Loops are used to repeat the same lines of code to reach a result aslong as the conditions of the loop are met.<br>
                    In the example above. If we get a coffee cup, but forget to put water in the kettle and then try to boil the water.<br>
                    The "Put water in kettle" condition is not met, So we will loop back to the start and meet that condition before we move onto step 3.

                </p>
            
                <h3><u>The DOM</u></h3>
                <p>Document Objet Model known more commonly as the DOM is a programming interface for web documents.<br>
                Which basically means a interface that lets you interact and manipulate web documents, in our case web pages.<br>
                This is done through a programming language, Most commonly javascript.<br>
                HTML has different tags/elements and we can use javascript to access those elements and manipulate them how we want through the DOM.<br>
                We might want to interact with a HTML tag through the DOM by changing the colour of a certain element.<br>
                The following command does this for us.<br>
                HTML: &lt;p&gt;id="changeColour">This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt;<br>
                Access this through DOM and change colour: document.getElementById("changeColour").style.color = "red";<br><br>
                </p>

                <h3><u>What are Functions and Why are they useful</u></h3>
                <p>Functions are a set of code that performs a task or calculates.<br> 
                    Functions take a input, do something, and then produce a output.<br>
                    Functions are useful as we can put alot of conditions,or tasks to be completed within that function
                    and then we can call that function anywhere in our code by its name, and it will give us an output.
                </p>
