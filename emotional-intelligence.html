                <h3><u>What is Emotional Intelligence?</u></h3>
                <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand your own emotions and the emotions of those around you.
                    Having emotional intelligence is having the ability to recognise how you are feeling, what those feelings mean, and how those feelings/emotions
                    can impact your behaviour, and also identify the emotions of others and how that is effecting their behaviour.
                </p>

                <h3><u>How is it different to IQ?</u></h3>
                <p>IQ which is short for Intelligence quotient, is the measure of your ability to reason and solve problems, and use logic, and to communicate complex
                    ideas.
                    Where as EQ measures your ability to recognize your own emotions and those emotions of others around you, and use that to guide your decisions.
                    </p>

                <h3><u>Why is it important?</u></h3>
                <p>Emotional Intelligence is important as it can help you communicate effectively with others. 
                    Having high EQ can help you network and build relationships with people. 
                    Knowing how to recognize your own and others emotions can help with defusing stress and conflict in team environments.
