            <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
            <section class="blog-post-content">
                <h3><u>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</u></h3>
                <p>Long term goal is to be a Web3 Developer, To particapate and help build all things Decentralized, And help change the world.<br>
                The pathway to get there I believe is a long one, But a possible one.<br>
                I will tend to start with front-end,work my way into Javascript, React, Typescript. From there I believe it will be more Backend, Then eventually Solidity and Smart Contracts.</p>
                
                <h3><u>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</u></h3>
                <p>My own strengths I believe is having the self-drive and focus and consistency to keep learning and progressing on my pathway to who I want to become.<br>
                My Limitations are Self belief which is a big one for me, That I have to get over and actually believe in myself.<br>
                Another Limitation is working with others, and accomplishing things as a collective or a group. I have not had alot
                of experience working with others nor do i have the social tendencies to interact with alot people.<br>
                This is something I recognize and something that I want to work on and overcome with the help from EDA and my peers.</p>
            
                <h3><u>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</u></h3>
                <p>I would like to see my social tendencies and trust in others grow and develop.<br>
                Also I would like to see my group project workload distribution and communication develop </p>

                <h3><u>How I will manage my workload</u></h3>
                <p>I will manage my workload by working to timestamps and taking it step by step, Without trying to look to far ahead<br>
                To work safely with others, I belive communication is a big factor, We all have different responsibilities in our
                daily lives and understanding these is always a big help to everyone involved. Communicating these and coming to a mutual understanding of what is expected when from who will help everyone in the process.<br>
                When Things build up, I take a break, decompress from all things screens/tech related and do something that is the complete opposite to what I was doing.
                This helps my brain to calm down and refresh.So when  I go back to what I was doing, I can look at it with a new mindset.</p>
            
                <h3><u>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</u></h3>
                <p>My first point of call is to always do my own research, and see if i can overcome my problem by myself.
                    Failing this I would then ask my peers on "Slack". After that if I am still stuck I will contact a 
                    facilitator privately and work through the steps I have taken and what I am trying to achieve.
                </p>

                <h3><u>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</u></h3>
                <p>I expect transperancy throughout the course, What is expected and how to go about it.<br>
                Also clear communication when asked upon, and just overall support and kindness towards everyone</p>
                    
                <h3><u>Scheduling Information / Block out dates</u></h3>
                <p>My sons 4th Birthday Sunday 13 February :) . I will not be available on any platform nor device.</p>
            
                <h3><u></u></h3>
