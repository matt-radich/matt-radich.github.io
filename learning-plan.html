            <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

            <h1 style = "font-size: 35px">BootCamp Learning Plan</h1>

            <section class="blog-post-content">

                <h3><u>LongTerm goal and career pathway</u></h3>
                <p> Long term goal is to be a full stack dev, and then move into Web3 development doing Blockchain, Smart Contracts etc..
                </p>

                <h3><u>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for</u></h3>
                <p>To create, collab and build some dope stuff that can maybe change the world, help people, And do that
                    with some dope people who I will hopefully call friends.
                </p>

                <h3><u>Impact I would like to make once I leave Dev Academy, Any destination in mind</u></h3>
                <p>No destination in mind, Anything that will help me grow and learn as a developer - definately stay within
                    the tech industry. As I learn and grow, I would like to keep progressing within my Stack and keep striving
                    for that end goal of been a Web3 dev working on big projects
                </p>

                <h3><u>Strengths and Limitations will be in BootCamp</u></h3>
                <p>My strengths and limitations will be relatively the same, I will still have the self-drive and focus to continue progressing
                    and learning. <br> Im working on the limitation of my self belief, By end of bootcamp I hope I can say
                    that I am who I think I am and who I ultimately want to become.<br>
                    Aswel as working on working with others, This has changed over foundations as I have reached out to a few people
                    who have been more then helpful and acccomodating to me and my problems I was facing. So moving forward
                    I believe I will continue to develop working with others and been ok with reaching out to people.<br>
                    Bootcamp will be alot more enjoyable and fun, If I can be comfortable talking and socialising with others - along with
                    having self belief and the focus that is needed. I think bootcamp can be something that I will be able to talk about
                    for years to come in a happy and memorable way.</p>

                <h3><u>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge at BootCamp</u></h3>
                <p>Biggest non-technical challenges will be, working in groups, speaking in front of people, sticking to time constraints, 
                    retaining what is best pratice to use where.</p>

                <h3><u>Non-Technical / Human-Skills I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy</u></h3>
                <p>I would like to see my overall confidence and self belief developed - I believe if I can work on this my thinking will be alot more clear,
                    I need to trust myself and my abilities. <br>
                    Along with this I would like my overall social/teamwork/pairing skills developed to a point where I am ok with talking 
                    to and infront of people whether it be one person or to a group of people.<br>
                    Self direction will be something I wish to develop and work on, As I tend to need abit of direction of where to start
                    and how to go about things - This may come down to my self-belief in my thinking and abilities overall</p>

                <h3><u>Expectations from BootCamp team, What does support look like to you</u></h3>
                <p>My expectations are just for the Bootcamp team to be available for support or to help.<br> To be open about 
                    opinions and different learning types. <br>
                    Support for me is to just be available, whether that be for a tech talk or just a talk in general.</p>

                <h3><u>Expectations for myself - seeking help - workload managment</u></h3>
                <p>Bootcamp is going to be alot, alot to work through, alot to learn, alot to communicate, alot of growing - technically and mentally.
                    I will manage my workload to the schedule that is asked, Turn up ontime - Do what is expected if not, do more.
                    This will be mainly managed through my journal - time and date keeping. 
                    Ask for help when stuck - sooner rather then later. Take breaks often, communicate how I am feeling and if I need help.</p>

            <h1 style = "font-size: 35px">Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

            <section class="blog-post-content">
               
                <h3><u>LongTerm goal and career pathway</u></h3>
                <p>Long term goal is to be a Web3 Developer, To particapate and help build all things Decentralized, And help change the world.<br>
                The pathway to get there I believe is a long one, But a possible one.<br>
                I will tend to start with front-end,work my way into Javascript, React, Typescript. From there I believe it will be more Backend, Then eventually Solidity and Smart Contracts.</p>
                
                <h3><u>Strengths & Limitations in relation to learning</u></h3>
                <p>My own strengths I believe is having the self-drive and focus and consistency to keep learning and progressing on my pathway to who I want to become.<br>
                My Limitations are Self belief which is a big one for me, That I have to get over and actually believe in myself.<br>
                Another Limitation is working with others, and accomplishing things as a collective or a group. I have not had alot
                of experience working with others nor do i have the social tendencies to interact with alot people.<br>
                This is something I recognize and something that I want to work on and overcome with the help from EDA and my peers.</p>
            
                <h3><u>Human Skills I would like to see developed while at EDA</u></h3>
                <p>I would like to see my social tendencies and trust in others grow and develop.<br>
                Also I would like to see my group project workload distribution and communication develop </p>

                <h3><u>Workload Management</u></h3>
                <p>I will manage my workload by working to timestamps and taking it step by step, Without trying to look to far ahead<br>
                To work safely with others, I belive communication is a big factor, We all have different responsibilities in our
                daily lives and understanding these is always a big help to everyone involved. Communicating these and coming to a mutual understanding of what is expected when from who will help everyone in the process.<br>
                When Things build up, I take a break, decompress from all things screens/tech related and do something that is the complete opposite to what I was doing.
                This helps my brain to calm down and refresh.So when  I go back to what I was doing, I can look at it with a new mindset.</p>
            
                <h3><u>Where I will seek Help</u></h3>
                <p>My first point of call is to always do my own research, and see if i can overcome my problem by myself.
                    Failing this I would then ask my peers on "Slack". After that if I am still stuck I will contact a 
                    facilitator privately and work through the steps I have taken and what I am trying to achieve.
                </p>

                <h3><u>Expectations from EDA team</u></h3>
                <p>I expect transperancy throughout the course, What is expected and how to go about it.<br>
                Also clear communication when asked upon, and just overall support and kindness towards everyone</p>
                    
                <h3><u>Blockout Dates</u></h3>
                <p>N/A</p>
            
                <h3><u></u></h3>
